# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the blockchain security documentation to assist readers in understanding technical jargon and blockchain-specific terminology.

- **Blockchain**: A distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

- **Smart Contract**: A programmable contract that executes automatically when predetermined conditions are met, implemented on a blockchain. Smart contracts allow for the execution of credible transactions without third parties.

- **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: A type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates in a decentralized manner, without a central authority, using smart contracts to facilitate trading directly between users.

- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**: A protocol that facilitates reliable and secure communication and data transfer between different blockchain networks. It is designed to create interoperability between sovereign blockchains.

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer. These algorithms are designed to provide security that is not compromised by the potential future development of quantum computing technologies.

- **Validator**: In the context of blockchain, particularly in networks like Cosmos, validators are participants who are responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain. They play a key role in the consensus mechanism, validating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.

- **Consensus Mechanism**: The process used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems. Blockchain uses various forms of consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), to agree on the validity of transactions.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)**: A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: An authentication method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism, typically combining passwords, security tokens, and biometric verification.

- **Bug Bounty Program**: A program offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.

- **Reentrancy Attack**: A common vulnerability in smart contracts, particularly in those written in Solidity for Ethereum, where a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract before resolving its own state, allowing attackers to repeatedly call the initial function.

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: A system where identity management is handled in a decentralized manner, allowing individuals to control their own identity without relying on any centralized authority. DIDs are used in various applications to enhance privacy and control over personal data.

This glossary will be updated as new technologies emerge and as the blockchain landscape evolves to ensure it remains a valuable resource for understanding blockchain security concepts.
